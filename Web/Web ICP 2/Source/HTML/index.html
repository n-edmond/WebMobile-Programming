          <br><p style = "color:white" >Personas are the strength of heart. They are an acceptance of one's faults and negative aspects of onesself they
              would rather ignore. These aspects do not always have to be negative though. In some cases, one may struggle to accept positive aspects about
              themselves or doubt their minds. Coming to terms with this can also lead to Persona awakening. Frequently, the awakenings can be painful, and
              failing to come to terms with it may cause one's shadow to go beserk placing one's life in danger.
            </p><br>

          <p style = "color:white" >The personas themselves belong to the <strong>sea of souls</strong>. They can become engrossed in strong, distorted desires
              and lose their identities, forgetting that they belong to everyone. Since they are a part of everyone, many times Personas can take the form of
              deities or mythological creatures. More information about Personas can be found <a href = "https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Persona_(concept)"
